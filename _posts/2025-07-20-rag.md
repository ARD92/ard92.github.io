## semantic search 
dense retrievals
re-ranking 

1. first obtain the data
2. chunk it (split by whitespace, new line etc )
3. create embeddings
4. store in vector DB (build searchable index)
5. search based on similarity

Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed, and pro
    duced by Christopher Nolan.
    It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin,
    Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine.
    Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film
    follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in
    search of a new home for mankind.
    Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its
    origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007.
    Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics[4] Kip Thorne
    was an executive producer, acted as a scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in
    book, The Science of Interstellar.
    Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the Panavision
    anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm.
    Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Iceland,
    and Los Angeles.
    Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects and the company
    Double Negative created additional digital effects.
    Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles.
    In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues
    using digital projectors.
    The film had a worldwide gross over $677 million (and $773 million with subse
    quent re-releases), making it the tenth-highest grossing film of 2014.
    It received acclaim for its performances, direction, screenplay, musical score,
    visual effects, ambition, themes, and emotional weight.
    It has also received praise from many astronomers for its scientific accuracy
    and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics. Since its premiere, Interstellar
    gained a cult following,[5] and now is regarded by many sci-fi experts as one
    of the best science-fiction films of all time.
    Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning
    Best Visual Effects, and received numerous other accolades

## Performing Similarity Search 

Vector DBs are used to store embeddings and when one wants to perform similarity search, the search will be against the vector space using a variety of methods such as cosine similarity. Vector DBs such as chroma DB can be used. But below examples are based on in memory vector stores such as FAISS

add a LLM to the search response. Helps reduce hallucinations and no need to fine tune the entire model again. This is how
perplexity and others work. search engine + summarizations
